<h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>
<p>This is a short chronicle of my visit to Italy. Click on the thumbnails to see a larger view of each photograph. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Pozzarello</h2>
<p><a href="window.html"><img src="thumbnails/window_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a> The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.</p>

<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
<p><a href="countryside.html"><img src="thumbnails/countryside_thumb.jpg" alt="the tuscan countryside" width="100" height="75"></a> This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</p>



<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
<p><a href="sienna.html"><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg" alt="the streets of sienna" width="75" height="100"></a> The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.</p>

<h2>Italian Pastries</h2>
<p><a href="sweets.html"><img src="thumbnails/sweets_thumb.jpg" alt="italian pastries" width="100" height="75"></a> One of the best part of my trip, foodtrip. Italian foods especially pastries are one of the great pride of the country.</p>

<h2>Sienna Cathedral</h2>
<p><a href="cathedral.html"><img src="thumbnails/cathedral_thumb.jpg" alt="medieval church in siena" width="75" height="100"></a> This is the Siena Cathedral, a medieval church in Siena, Italy. This cathedral is one of the most fascinating in all of Italy and certainly one of the most impressive features in Siena for me. </p>

<h2>Lavender</h2>
<p><a href="lavander.html"><img src="thumbnails/lavender_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="75" height="100"></a> We all know that lavender is a beautiful plant and that it has a pleasant scent. In Italy there are many places where you can enjoy these beautiful violet flowers. </p>
